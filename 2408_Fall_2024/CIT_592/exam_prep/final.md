  1. $`n\cdot\left(\frac{n-1}{n}\right)^k`$
  2. $`1000\cdot\left(\frac{999}{1000}\right)^{1000}`$
  3. $`\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} n\cdot\left(\frac{n-1}{n}\right)^n \approx \frac{n}{e}`$
  4. Even when $`k=n`$, some slots are expected to remain empty because keys are placed independently and uniformly at random across slots. This randomness leads to the phenomenon where, due to the probability distribution, not every slot gets filled, even when the number of keys equals the number of slots.      
    This is related to the concept of collisions and load factor $`(\frac{k}{n})`$ in hash tables. A load factor of 1  does not guarantee all slots are filled due to collisions. In practice, a hash table's efficiency is often maintained by keeping the load factor below 1 to reduce the chance of collisions, which can impact performance in searching and inserting elements.
