# 2.2 Indexed Families

### Concept) Sequence
- Def.)
  - Given a set $`A`$, a **sequence** is an ordered $`n`$-tuple $`(a_1, \cdots, a_n) \in A^n`$ of elements from $`A`$, for some natural number $`n`$.
- Props.)
  - Elements of a sequence need not be distinct.
  - Order is important.
    - e.g.)
      - $`(a_1, a_2, a_1)`$ and $`(a_2, a_1, a_1)`$ are distinct sequences in $`A^3`$
  - Actually, the above is a **finite set**.
    - This can be viewed as a function from $`\{1,2,\cdots, n\}`$ to the set $`A`$
      - where the $`i`$-th element of the sequence $`(a_1, \cdots, a_n)`$ is an image of $`i`$ under the function.
      - i.e.) $`s:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow A`$

### Concept) Index Set
- Why needed?)
  - To tag each element uniquely.
- Def.)
  - Given a set $`A`$, an $`I`$-indexed family of elements of $`A`$ is a function
    - $`a: I \rightarrow A`$
      - where $`I`$ is any set viewed as an index set.
- Prop.)
  - The family $`a`$ can be viewed as the set of pairs $`a = \{(i,a(i)) | i\in I\}`$.
    - Why?)
      - The function $`a`$ is determined by its graph $`\{(i,a(i)) | i\in I\}`$.
  - Notation)
    - $`a_i \equiv a(i)`$
    - $`(a_i)_{i\in I} \equiv (a = \{(i,a(i)) | i\in I\})`$
- cf.)
  - A multiset is not an indexed family.
    - Why?) The order does not matters.

### Proposition 2.6)
- Theorem)
  - Given any nonempty set $`A`$ equipped with an associative and commutative binary operation $`+: A\times A \rightarrow A`$
    - for any two nonempty finite sequences $`I`$ and $`J`$ of distinct natural numbers such that $`J`$ is a permutation of $`I`$,
    - for every sequence $`(a_i)_{i\in I}`$ of elements in $`A`$,
      -  we have $`\displaystyle \sum_{\alpha \in I} a_\alpha = \sum_{\alpha \in J} a_\alpha`$
