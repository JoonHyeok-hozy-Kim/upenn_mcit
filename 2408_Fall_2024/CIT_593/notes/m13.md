### Concept) Dynamic Memory Allocation
- Desc.)
  - "Dynamic" means "at run-time"
    - Not "at compile time"
- How?)
  - Stack memory cannot support the dynamic memory allocation.
    - e.g.)
        ```c
        int length = 2;
        int int_array[length];  // This one won't be compiled
        ```
        - Why?)
          - The value `2` is assigned at `length` during the runtime.
          - Thus, at the compile time, we cannot allocate the memory with the size of `length`.
  - Instead, **heap** memory can support this.

### Concept) Heap API (malloc, free)
- Desc.)
  - Two basic functions that the programmer can interface with heap.
  - Heap is managed by user-level C runtime library: `libc`
  - Interface function declarations found in `stdlib.h`
- Functions)
  - `void* malloc(size_t size)`
    - Returns
      - a void pointer `void*` to a region on the heap of size in bytes.
        - i.e.) returning a generic pointer!
      - NULL if heap cannot fullfil request.
        - e.g.) Heap memory is full.
  - `void free(void* ptr)`
    - It clears reservation for address pointed to be `ptr`.
    - `malloc` must have reserved this address.
    - The identifier doesn't matter. It works with the address that the identifier is pointing at.
- Examples)
  - 1. Creating an Array at Runtime
  - 2. Returning addresses on the Heap from Functions
  - 3. Heap vs Other Regions of Memory
  - 4. Multidimensional Arrays on the Heap
  - 5. Structures on the Heap
  - 6. Pointers to Structures on the Heap
