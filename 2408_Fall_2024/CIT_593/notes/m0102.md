# Module 01-02 Bits and Bytes

### Concept) Binary Multiplication
![](../images/m0102_001.png)

<br>

### Concept) Finite Width and Overflow
![](../images/m0102_002.png)
- e.g.)
  - Addition
    - The sum of two $`n`$-bit numbers can have $`(n+1)`$-bits.
  - Multiplication
    - The product of two $`n`$-bit numbers can have $`(2n)`$-bits

<br>

### Concept) Bit, Nibble, Byte
- 1 nibble = 4 bits
- 1 byte = 8 bits

<br>

### Concept) How to represent negative integers in binary
#### 1) Sign-magnitude
![](../images/m0102_003.png)

#### 2) 1's Complement
![](../images/m0102_004.png)

#### 3) 2's Complement
![](../images/m0102_005.png)
- Concept) Overflow in 2's Complement
  - If you add two positive numbers and get a negative result
  - If you add two negative numbers and get a positive result
    - e.g.)   
      ![](../images/m0102_006.png)

### Tech) Converting Binaries into 2's Complements
1. Tech 1
   - How?)
     - Flip all digits.
     - Add 1.
2. Tech 2
   - How?)
     - Copy bits from right to left up to and including the first 1.
     - Flip remaining bits
   - e.g.)   
     ![](../images/m0102_007.png)
3. Tech 3
   - How?)
     - Given a 2's Complement number X, to negate it
   - e.g.)   
     ![](../images/m0102_008.png)

<br>

### Concept) Sign Extension
![](../images/m0102_009.png)

### Concept) Encoding : ASCII and Unicode
![](../images/m0102_010.png)

<br>

### Concept) Hexadecimal Notation
![](../images/m0102_011.png)
- Tech.) Converting (Binary) <-> (Hexadecimal)   
   ![](../images/m0102_012.png)

<br>

### Tech.) Representing Fractions in Binary
- There are two ways to do it.
  1. [Fixed-Point]()
  2. [Floating-Point]

#### Concept) Fixed-Point
- How?)
  - Use a **binary point** just like the decimal point (소숫점) in the decimal system.   
    ![](../images/m0102_013.png)
- Problem)
  - Representing the **binary point**!
    - Thus, we use floating point.

#### Concept) Floating-Point
- How?)
  - Use the scientific notation of representing numbers.
    - Sign, Fraction, and Exponent   
      ![](../images/m0102_014.png)
      - Bias in exponent : To represent negative integers without [2's complements](#3-2s-complement).
- e.g.)   
  ![](../images/m0102_015.png)
- Prop.)
  - Floating point numbers are inherently approximate.
    - Why?)
      - Representing a rational number in binary system incurs roundoff errors.
