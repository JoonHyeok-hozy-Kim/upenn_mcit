### Concept) Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)
- Desc.)
  - Programmer-visible components and operations
  - It contains everything needed to create a program for CPU.
  - It serves as a contract between programmer and CPU designer.
    - Different implementations of same ISA are "binary compatible"
  - It is backward compatible
    - i.e.) The ones worked for previous version of ISA also works for the future versions.

## 6.1 Basic Components
### Concept) Memory
- Props.)
  ||Our LC-4|Real ISAs|
  |:-:|:-|:-|
  |Address Space|- $`2^{16}`$ locations|- $`2^{64}`$ locations|
  |Addressability|- $`16`$-bits <br> - Data type can be 16-bit 2C int, ASCII chars, RGB pixels. <br> - Floating point not supported.|- $`8`$-bits <br> - But can read/write data in different size chunks (1,2,4,8 bytes)|
- Partitions)
  - Program Memory : Stores instructions
  - Data Memory : Stores data for the long term

<br>

### Concept) Registers
- Types)
  - Register File
    - 8 registers of 16-bits wide each
      - Mnemonic Naming : R0, R1, R2, ..., R7
      - Binary Reference : 000, 001, 002, ..., 111
      - Hexadecimal Reference : x00, x01, x02, ..., x07
  - Program Counter
    - 16-bits
      - Why?) 
        - Recall that the Program Memory had $`2^{16}`$ locations.
    - Hexadecimal Notation
      - i.e.) x0000 ~ xFFFF
  - Processor Status-Word Register (PSR)
    - NZP result of each cycle is stored here.
    - 16-bit PSR
    - This includes NZP condition codes.
    - Not directly accessible, but used by instructions.

<br>

### Concept) Instruction Set
- Types)
  - Total of 29 instructions in 7 instruction categories:
    1. Arithmetic Instructions (ADD/SUB/MUL/DIVIDE/ETC)
    2. Logical Instructions (BITWISE AND, OR, ETC)
    3. Shift Instructions
    4. Comparison Instructions
    5. Load/Store Instructions
    6. Loading Constants
    7. Program Control
       - Branches
       - Jumps
       - TRAP/RTI â€“ Operating System Calls
- Format)
  - Fixed length of 16-bit instruction : $`I[15:0]`$
    - Optcode : $`I[15:12]`$
      - It specifies datapath control signals.
