# 4. Sequential Logic to Memory
### Concept) Combinational Logic vs Sequential Logic
|Logic Type|Desc.|
|:-:|:-|
|Combinational Logic|- Always gives the same output for a given set of inputs <br> - Stateless|
|Sequential Logic|- Its output depends on its inputs & its last output! <br> - Forms the basis for “state” or “memory” for a computer|

## 4.1 Sequential Logic
- Three Basic Sequential Logic Gates
  - [R-S Latch]()
  - [D-Latch]()
  - [D-Flip-Flop]()

### Concept) R-S Latch

- Props.)
  - A **bi-stable** circuit 
    - i.e.) it can happily exist in either of two stable states.
    - You can push the latch from one state to another by **setting** or **resetting** it with the S-R signals
    - The logic levels are maintained because of the feedback paths from outputs to inputs.
