# 8. IO and OS
### Concept) IO Controller
- Desc.)
  - It acts as a translator between digital (CPU) and Analog (Device)   
    ![](../images/m08/001.png)
    - Components)
      - Control/Status : One or two register(s) working as a flag
      - Data : More than one register.
- How it works)
  - Input Devices)
    - CPU checks **status register** if input is available.
    - Then it reads input from **data register**.
  - Output Devices)
    - CPU checks **status register** if output device is available.
    - Then it writes output to **data register**.
- Implementation)
  - Two options)
    1. Creating new "I/O instructions" for ISA.
       - How?)
         - Designate opcode(s) for I/O
         - Register and operation encoded in instruction
       - For early computers, since I/O devices were fixed, it worked this way.
    2. [Memory-Mapped I/O](#concept-memory-mapped-io)

<br>

### Concept) Memory-Mapped I/O
- Disclaimer)
  - This code should be implemented in the OS level. : `PSR[15]`=0
    - Why?)
      - The memory addresses of HW are located at xC000~xFFFF in the memory.
      - The existence of OS is to do jobs with the HW.
  - Refer to [TRAP/RTI](#concept-trap--rti-instruction) for more explanation.
- Desc.)
  - Assign a memory address to each device register

    |<img src="../images/m08/002.png" width="500px">|e.g.)<br> Keyboard status register (`KBSR`): xFE00 <br> - `KBSR[15]` is 1 if keyboard has new character <br> Keyboard data register (`KBDR`): xFE02 <br> - `KBDR[7:0]` is last character input on keyboard <br> ASCII display status register (`ADSR`): xFE04 <br> - `ADSR[15]` is 1 if console ready to display next character <br> ASCII display data register (`ADDR`): xFE06 <br> - `ADDR[7:0]` is written to console|
  - Use conventional loads (`LDR`) and stores (`STR`)
  - Hardware intercepts loads/stores to these address
  - No actual memory access performed
- e.g.)
  - Pressing 'A' on keyboard
    - Procedure)
      1. User presses ‘A’ key on keyboard
      2. Electronics box converts ‘A’ to ASCII: 0100 0001
         - places this data into data register
      3. Electronics box sets MSB of [status register](#concept-io-controller) to ‘1’
      4. Programmer checks status register
         - by reading address 0xFE00
      5. If MSB = 1, programmer reads [data register](#concept-io-controller)
         - by reading address 0xFE02
      6. Electronics box reset [status register](#concept-io-controller) after read.
    - Code)
      ```Assembly
      ; code will read 1 character from the keyboard, store it in R0
      OS_KBSR_ADDR .UCONST xFE00 ; ‘alias’ for keyboard status reg
      OS_KBDR_ADDR .UCONST xFE02 ; ‘alias’ for keyboard data reg

      .CODE
      GETC ; a LABEL for now (perhaps subroutine someday)
        LC R0, OS_KBSR_ADDR ; R0 = address of keyboard status reg
        LDR R0, R0, #0      ; R0 = value of keyboard status reg
        BRzp GETC           ; if R0[15]=1, data is waiting!
                            ; else, loop and check again...

      ;; reaching here, means data is waiting in keyboard data reg
        LC R0, OS_KBDR_ADDR ; R0 = address of keyboard data reg
        LDR R0, R0, #0      ; R0 = value of keyboard data reg
      ```
      - Directives)
        |Directive|Desc.|
        |:-:|:-|
        |`.UNCONST`|- Associate UIMM16 (Unsigned 16-bit Int) with preceding label <br> - Not like `.FILL`, it does not show up in data memory.|
        |`.LC`|- Load constant value at label rather than address of label <br> - cf.) `LEA` reads address of the label.|
  - Read from Keyboard and print to screen
    - Code
      ```Assembly
      OS_KBSR_ADDR .UCONST xFE00    ; ‘alias’ for keyboard status reg
      OS_KBDR_ADDR .UCONST xFE02    ; ‘alias’ for keyboard data reg
      OS_ADSR_ADDR .UCONST xFE04    ; ‘alias’ for ASCII display status reg
      OS_ADDR_ADDR .UCONST xFE06    ; ‘alias’ for ASCII display data reg

      .CODE
      ;; Keyboard Read Code
      GETC
        LC R0, OS_KBSR_ADDR
        LDR R0, R0, #0
        BRnz GETC
        LC R0, OS_KBDR_ADDR
        LDR R0, R0, #0          ; Read Keyboard input and write on R0.
      
      ;; ASCII Display Write Code
      PUTC
        LC R1, OS_ADSR_ADDR
        LDR R1, R1, #0
        BRnz PUTC
        LC R1, OS_ADDR_ADDR
        STR R0, R1, #0          ; Write R0 to ASCII Display(R1)
      ```

### Concept) Timer
- Components)
  - Timer Interval Register (TIR)
    - Memory Address : xFE0A
    - Functionality : Set desired time in TIR in milliseconds. 
  - Timer Status Register (TSR)
    - Memory Address : xFE08
    - Functionality : `TSR[15]` is 1 if timer has “gone off”, sets itself to 0 after read
- How it works)
  - Just like a timer...
  - Time set on TIR in the millisecond unit.
  - When the time set on TIR passes, `TSR[15]` is updated to 1.
  - When the result is read, `TSR[15]` is reset to 0.

<br>

### Concept) Video
- Components)
  - Video Display Control Register (VDCR)
    - Memory Address : xFE0C
  - Video Display Data Registers
    - Memory Address : xC000 ~ xFE0C
      - Each address denotes a pixel.
        - Each pixel has 16-bit addressability.
          - MSB not used.
          - 5-bits for Red, Green and Blue
      - xFE0C - xC000 = $`128 \times 124`$ = 15,872 pixels.
        - How to address pixels
          ```Assembly
          .ADDR xC000                    ; The left-upper most pixel address.
          OS_VIDEO_MEM .BLKW x3E00       ; x3E00 rows total.
          OS_VIDEO_NUM_COLS .UCONST #128 ;
          OS_VIDEO_NUM_ROWS .UCONST #124 ;

          ; video_memory[y][x]
          LEA R0, xC000
          TBD...
          ```

<br>

### Concept) TRAP / RTI Instruction
- Ideation)
  - Recall that the [memory is partitioned into User and OS](#recall-that-memory-is-partitioned-into-user-and-os).
    - `PSR[15]`=0 : User region
    - `PSR[15]`=1 : OS region
  - The reason that OS exists is to separate the control of hardware.
  - Thus, we block User Codes from modifying data in x8000 ~ xFFFF of the memory.
    - e.g.) Keyboard at xFE00
  - Still, we need a command to ask to do the job with the HW
  - TRAP and RTI are the instructions for that.
    - Why not JSR?) 
      - Recall that performs `PC = (PC & x8000 | IMM11 << 4)`.
      - Which means that if JSR was called in the User code, the MSB of PC will be copied into 0.
      - Thus, it cannot access x8000 and beyond.
- Desc.)
  |Mnemonic|Semantics|Encoding|
  |:-:|:-|:-:|
  |TRAP UIMM8|`R7 = PC + 1` : Store current PC+1 <br> `PC = (x8000 \| UIMM8)` : MSB set to 1. <br> `PSR[15] = 1` : Elevates the privilege level of the CPU form 0 to 1.|1111----UUUUUUUU|
  |RTI|`PC = R7` : Go back to User Code <br> `PSR[15]=0` : Lowers the privilege level of the CPU from 1 to 0|1000--111-------|
  - The UIMM8 argument for the `TRAP` instruction is the [TRAP vector table](#concept-trap-vector-table).

<br>

### Concept) TRAP Vector Table
- Ideation)
  - Recall that the [TRAP](#concept-trap--rti-instruction) instruction takes the UIMM8 value as an argument.
  - Thus, using `TRAP`, we may jump to only $`2^8 = 256`$ lines.
    - `TRAP x00` = `PC = x8000`
    - `TRAP xFF` = `PC = x80FF`.
  - In order to utilize the rest of OS Program Memory (x8100 ~ x9FFF), engineers devised TRAP Vector Table.
- Def.)
  - The first 256 lines of OS Program Memory.
  - Its contents are the `JMP` instructions to labels implemented in x8100 ~ x9FFF (OS Program Memory - TRAP Vector Table.)
- e.g.)
  ```Assembly
  .OS
  .CODE
  .ADDR x8000
    JMP TRAP_GETC       ; x00
    JMP TRAP_PUTC       ; x01
    JMP TRAP_DRAW_H_LINE; x02
    ...
    JMP TRAP_TURNOFF_CPU; xFF
  ```
  ```Assembly
  .OS
  .CODE
  .ADDR x8300
  TRAP_GETC ;; this is TRAP x00
    LC R0, OS_KBSR_ADDR
    LDR R0, R0, #0
    BRzp TRAP_GETC
    LC R0, OS_KBDR_ADDR
    LDR R0, R0, #0
    RTI
  TRAP_PUTC ;; this is TRAP x01
    LC R1, OS_ADSR_ADDR
    LDR R1, R1, #0
    BRzp TRAP_PUTC
    LC R1, OS_ADDR_ADDR 
    STR R0, R1, #0
    RTI
  ```
- Prop.)
  - Be careful with overwriting the values on the register.
    - Desc.)
      - Recall that the User Program uses registers for the operations.
      - And when it calls the TRAP instruction, the related HW related operation will also use the register for its own operations.
    - Sol.) Back up the Register File
      ```Assembly
      TEMPS .UCONST x4200   ; Label the temporary storage as TEMP and assign x4200.
      LC R7, TEMPS          ; Load the address of TEMPS into R7
      STR R0, R7, #0        ; Store R0 in TEMPS[0]
      STR R1, R7, #1        ; Store R1 in TEMPS[1]
      STR R2, R7, #2        ; Store R2 in TEMPS[2]
      STR R3, R7, #3        ; Store R3 in TEMPS[3]
      STR R4, R7, #4        ; Store R4 in TEMPS[4]
      STR R5, R7, #5        ; Store R5 in TEMPS[5]
      STR R6, R7, #6        ; Store R6 in TEMPS[6]
      
      TRAP x03              ; Call a TRAP instruction

      LC R7, TEMPS          ; Load the address of TEMPS into R7
      LDR R0, R7, #0        ; Restore R0 from TEMPS[0]
      ```

### Concept) Operating Systems (OS)
- What it does)
  - Handle I/O
  - Virtualize HW for user applications
  - User programs ask OS to perform I/O on their behalf.
    - Why?)
      1. Standardization
         - User programs shouldn’t have to deal with IF between I/O devices.
      2. Raise the level of abstraction
         - Wrap nasty physical interfaces with nice logical ones
      3. Enforce isolation
         - Makes the whole system more stable and secure

<br>

### Concept) Synchronization
#### Concept) Polling
- Desc.)
  - CPU keeps checking status register in a loop.
- e.g.)
  - `GETC`, `PUTC` we implemented above.
- Prop.)
  - Very inefficient.
  - Wasting CPU.

#### Concept) Interrupts
- How it works)
  - Device sends special signal to CPU when status changes.
  - CPU stops current program, saves its state.
  - CPU “handles interrupt”: checks status, moves data
  - CPU resumes stopped program, as if nothing happened.
- Prop.)
  - Interrupt driven I/O is asynchronous.
