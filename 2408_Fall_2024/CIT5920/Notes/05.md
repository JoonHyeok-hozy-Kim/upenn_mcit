# 5. Permutations and Combinations
### Concept) Permutation
- Desc.)
  - Permutations occur when counting sequences without repetitions.
- Notations)
  - $`n! \equiv n\times (n-1)\times \cdots \times 2 \times 1`$
  - $`\displaystyle P(n,r) \equiv \underbrace{n\times (n-1)\times \cdots \times (n-r+1)}_{r \textrm{ items}} = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!}`$

### Concept) Combination
- Desc.)
  - Choice without order mattering.
- Notation)
  - $`\displaystyle \begin{pmatrix} n\\r \end{pmatrix} \equiv \frac{n!}{(n-r)! r!}`$

### Concept) The k to 1 Rule
- Def.)
  - For
    - $`f:X\rightarrow Y`$ : a function
    - $`k \in \mathbb{R}`$
  - $`\forall y\in Y, \exists X' \subset X \textrm{ such that } (f(x') = y, \forall x'\in X') \wedge (|X'|=k\in\mathbb{R})`$
- Prop.)
  - $`\displaystyle |Y| = \frac{|X|}{k}`$
- e.g.)
  - How many binary strings of length 16 have exactly 4 1s?
    - Sol.) $`\begin{pmatrix} 16 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}`$
