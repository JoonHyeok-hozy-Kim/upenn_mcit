# 6. Tricky Combinatorics

### Concept) Arrangements of Non-Distinct
#### Theorem)
- Let
  - $`k`$ : the number of total objects
  - $`k_i`$ : the number of the $`i`$-th type object for $`i=1,2,\cdots, n`$
- Then the total number of possible arrangements of these objects in a straight line are
  - $`\displaystyle\frac{k!}{k_1! k_2! \cdots k_n!}`$
- e.g.)
  - Q) In how many ways can the letters of the word PHILIPPINES be rearranged?
    - Sol.) $`\displaystyle\frac{11!}{3!3!}`$

### Concept) Counting Integer solutions to Certain Types of Equations
$${\color{red} \star \; Be careful! \star }$$
- e.g.) 
  - How many non-negative integer solutions can be found for the following equation $`x_1+x_2+x_3=8`$
    - Sol.)
      - Arranging 8 balls and 2 separators.
        - i.e.) $`\displaystyle \frac{10!}{8!2!} = \begin{pmatrix} 10 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}`$

### Concept) Multiset
- Def.)
  - A set with duplicated items
- e.g.)
  - Q) Given a set $`\{1,2,3,4\}`$, how many 4 element multisets are there?
    - Sol.)
      - Let $`x_i`$ denote the number of the $`i`$ element in the multiset.
      - Then the problem is identical to $`\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^4 x_i = 4`$
      - Recalling the [problem above](#concept-counting-integer-solutions-to-certain-types-of-equations), the solution is to arrange 4 balls and 3 separators.
      - Thus, $`\begin{pmatrix} 7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}`$ 
  - Q) Suppose you have 5 girls and 3 boys. You want to arrange them (in a line) in such a way that you do not have 2 boys standing next to each other.
    - Sol.)
      - $`5!`$ ways to arrange girls.
      - $`P(6,3)`$ : 6 spots for 3 boys.
      - Thus, $`5! \cdot P(6,3)`$
