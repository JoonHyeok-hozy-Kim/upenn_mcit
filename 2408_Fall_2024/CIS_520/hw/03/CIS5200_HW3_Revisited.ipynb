        "In this problem, we'll implement a simplified version of random forests. We'll be using the `iris` dataset, which has 4 features that are discretized to $0.1$ steps between $0$ and $8$ (i.e. the set of all possible features is $\\{0.1, 0.2, \\dots, 7.8, 7.9\\}$. Thus, all thresholds that we'll need to consider are $\\{0.15, 0.25, \\dots, 7.75, 7.85\\}$.\n",
        "\n",
        "Your task in this first part is to finish the implementation of decision trees. We've provided a template for some of the decision tree code, following which you'll finish the bagging algorithm to get a random forest.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Entropy (2pts): calculate the entropy of a given vector of labels in the `entropy` function. Note that the generalization of entropy to 3 classes is $H = -\\sum_{i=1}^3 p_i\\log(p_i)$ where $p_i$ is the proportion of examples with label $i$.\n",
        "2. Find the best split (1pt): finish the `find_split` function by finding the feature index and value that results in the split minimizing entropy.\n",
        "3. Build the tree (2pts): finish the `expand_node` function by completing the recursive call for building the decision tree.\n",
        "4. Predict with tree (2pts): implement the `predict_one` function, which makes a prediction for a single example.\n",
        "\n",
        "Throughout these problems, the way we represent the decision tree is by using python dicts. In particular, a node is a `dict` that can have the following keys:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. `node['label']` Return the label that we should predict upon reaching this node. node should **only** have a `label` entry if it is a leaf node.\n",
        "2. `node['left']` points to another node dict that represents this node's left child.\n",
        "3. `node['right']` points to another node dict that represents this node's right child.\n",
        "4. `node['split']` is a tuple containing the feature index and value that this node splits left versus right on.\n",
        "\n",
        "In our implementation, all comparisons will be **greater than** comparisons, and \"yes\" answers go **left**. In other words, if `node['split'] = (2, 1.25)`, then we expect to find all data remaining at this node with feature 2 value **greater** than 1.25 in `node['left']`, and feature value **less** than 1.25 in `node['right']`.\n",
