- Yonghyun Park
  - Two projects
    - Video prompting model project
      - Goal)
        - In-context learning
      - current status
        - focusing on reasoning properties and logical puzzles
        - Use Open source Model : Wan2.2
          - e.g.) sudoku
        - Experiment) Find simple tasks for base video model giving language prompts and initial image
          - How?)
            - Give prompt and let video model solve problems
          - e.g.)
            - rotation, resizing, symmetry
              - all failed in the model
                - why?) Open models lack prompt alignment
            - Maze problem worked
      - Future goal)
        - Give video prompt
    - Distillation of the video model (pi-Flow)
      - Original implementation is too complicated.
      - Reproduce the paper in simple code
        - reference) minRF
      - Down side
        - Gaussian mixture model -> Unstable, less expressive
- Han
  - world model for robots
    - experiment)
      - Goal)
        - Use (action map + RGB video) to represent the action of the robot
          - action map is controllable
      - Methods)
        - use pretrained model to learn those
      - result)
        - working on implementing diffusion model with action map
    - Prof.)
      - Video input may enhance current robot models
        - but too expensive
        - action map as a cheaper alternative
- Andrew
  - 3D Motion generation
    - existing literature
      - problem) 3d motion data is too expensive
      - idea) use 2d data instead
        - sds, reinforcement learning
          - test time : costly
        - distillation 
          - one candidate approach
        - bench mark existing paper
          - create sequence of prompts to aid the lack of data.
  - Prof.)
    - the existing source has consistency?
      - yes! 
    - skelaton data creation capable?
      - yes
- Joon
  - Discrete Diffusion Model
- YiFan
  - same project with Han
- Yiqian
  - working on implementing  action denoiser
- Zhiyuan
  - explicit cot mechanism for TTS
    - Deepseek use reinforcement learning to reasoning
  - perpetual cot cycle
    - even without the audio create place holder when there is pause in conversation
  - Prof.)
- Guancheng
  - Deep research agent
    - like gpt deep research assistance
    - competetion NEIRLIPS
      - BUILD deep research systems
      - optimizing the current process
- Mutian
  - video generation with 3d, 4d trajectory aware
    - test
      - 2 different representation
        - frame by frame 3d
        - more coherent trajectory representation from 1st frame
          - trying to change the view point
  - unified world model for robotics with Han
  - workshop
    - prof.) talk on 3d world model
      - Interesting point)
        - scholars have different definition on spatial intelligence
          - is llm needed?
            - yes for Normalizing flow case?
            - maybe no because animals learn spatial intelligence without language
- Lulu
  - inference time scaling for video generation model
    - Looking at paper that...  
      - Use tree of frames and calculate scores and heap sort, prune low score -> video guidance.
      - learning experimental setup based on this paper
    - Also trying different prompts on video generation models
      - Ideas)
        - use yes/no questions only
- Yao
  - working on latent reinforcement learning
  - workshop mentioned by Mutian
    - ideas on token
      - visual problems
    - How do we achieve fine grained
      - in rl, reward is given to tokens.
      - for complex reasoning, longer sequence
