Optional Practical Training (OPT) is a work authorization granted by USCIS for F-1 students, allowing them to gain practical experience in their field of study. A key advantage is that no job offer is required at the time of application. Both paid and unpaid positions are allowed, provided the work is directly related to the studentâ€™s major. Employment must be at least 20 hours per week to count as full time.

The application process begins by requesting an updated I-20 through iPenn, which usually takes seven days. After receiving the I-20, students must file Form I-765 with USCIS within 30 days. The process typically takes three to four months unless premium processing is used, which costs $1,648. Once approved, students receive an Employment Authorization Document (EAD) and may begin working only after the EAD start date is reached. They must report employment through iPenn within 10 days and keep all updates current.

Key dates include the September 19 application start, the December 18 program end, and February 16 as the latest filing date. Students cannot exceed 90 days of unemployment, counted from the EAD start date. Travel is generally safe before program completion but discouraged afterward. A STEM extension provides an additional 24 months of work authorization and requires a paid job and submission of Form I-983.

### How would you define the purpose of this event/presentation (at least 3 sentences)?
- The US immigration process is quite complicated, and many international students have difficulty in dealing with it. OPT is a great opportunity for them to work after the education. This event is held to introduce the OPT program to the international students, so that they can benefit from it.



<br>

### What part of the presentation was most useful to your learning or goals (at least 3 sentences)?
- The contents were well organized. And, the presenter went over the details giving enough time for the listeners to understand the new concepts. QnA session was very helpful as well.
