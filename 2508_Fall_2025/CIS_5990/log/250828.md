### Goal)
Keep on testing `run_one_replication`.

- `trbo_state.initialize_standard()` : Initialize TRs one by one. 
  - By default `HyperVolumeTrustRegion` is used. Later with the `switch_strategy` flag, we may use `ScalarizationTrustRegion`.
  - `decay` function is used to adjust TR's length init value.
    - As `n_eval` gets closer to `max_eval`, default initial length approaches $`L_{\min}`$

### What to do next
Understand `TS_select_batch_MORBO` logic called by `run_one_replication`.
