### Email

Hello Dr. Gardner,

I hope you're having a great start to the semester.

I'm writing to gently follow up on my previous email about scheduling our weekly meeting for CIS 5990. I know you must be very busy with the start of classes, so I just wanted to bring this to the top of your inbox.

As a quick update on my research direction, I’ve put together a brief slide deck outlining the MOBy-DiC concept I mentioned earlier—adapting TuRBO and MORBO to generate a diverse set of solutions. I have attached it to this email for your convenience. There's no need to review it in detail beforehand, but I thought it might serve as a helpful starting point for our first discussion.


My schedule is flexible outside of my class times, so please let me know what time works for you.

Thank you, and I'm very much looking forward to our work this semester.

Best,
Joon
