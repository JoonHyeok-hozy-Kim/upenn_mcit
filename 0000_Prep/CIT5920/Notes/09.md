# 9. Conditional Probability
- Def.)
  - $`\displaystyle P(E|F) = \frac{P(E \cap F)}{P(F)}`$
- e.g.)
  - Settings)
    - Rolling a red die and a blue die.
    - $`E`$ : the event of the two dice summing to 11
    - $`F`$ : the event of the blue die has the value of 5
  - Then
    - $`\displaystyle P(E \cap F) = \frac{1}{36}`$
    - $`\displaystyle P(F) = \frac{6}{36}`$
  - Thus,    
    - $`\displaystyle P(E|F) = \frac{1}{6}`$
- Usage)
  - Conditional probability can be used to **split** up the probability of an event conditioned by the occurrence of some other event.
    - e.g.)
      - Settings)
        - A student knows 80% of the material on a true-false exam.
        - If the student knows the material, she has a 95% chance of getting it right.
        - If the student does not know the material she just guesses and as expected has just a 50% chance of getting it right.
      - Question)
        - What is the probability of getting the question right?
      - Sol.)
        - Then
          - $`P(Know) = 0.8`$
          - $`\displaystyle P(Right|Know) = \frac{P(Right \cap Know)}{P(Know)} = 0.95 \Rightarrow P(Right \cap Know) = 0.8\times0.95 = 0.76`$
          - $`\displaystyle P(Right|Know^c) = \frac{P(Right \cap Know^c)}{P(Know^c)} = 0.5 \Rightarrow P(Right \cap Know^c) = 0.2\times0.5 = 0.1`$
        - Thus, $`P(Right) = P(Right \cap Know) + P(Right \cap Know^c) = 0.86`$

### Concept) Independence
- Def.)
  - $`E \textrm{ and } F \textrm{ are independent if } \begin{cases}
    P(E|F) = P(E) \\ P(E \cap F) = P(E)P(F) \\ P(F|E) = P(F)
  \end{cases}`$
