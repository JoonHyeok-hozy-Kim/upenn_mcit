# 16. Induction 2
### Concept) Strong Induction
- Template)
  - Let
    - $`P(n)`$ be a predicate parametrized by a natural number $`n`$.
    - $`a\le b`$
      - where $`a,b\in \mathbb{R}`$.
  - Then
    - $`P(n)`$ is true for all $`n\ge a`$, if the following two conditions hold:
      1. The Base Case
         - $`P(a), P(a+1), \cdots, P(b-1)`$ are true.
      2. Inductive Step
         - $`\forall k \ge b`$
           - $`P(j) \textrm{ is true for } j \in [a,k) \Rightarrow P(k) \textrm{ is true }`$
  - Alternatively...
    - $`P(a) \wedge P(a+1) \wedge P(k-1) \rightarrow P(k), \forall k\ge b`$

#### E.g.) Division Theorem
- Theorem)
  - Let $`n`$ be a positive integer.
  - Then for every non negative integer $`m`$, there exist unique integers $`q`$ and $`r`$ such that $`m = nq+r`$ and $`0\le r \lt n`$.
- pf. by induction)
  - Case 1) $`m \lt n`$
    - For $`q = 0, m=r`$, the theorem holds.
  - Case 2) $`n \le m \lt 2n`$
    - Then $`m-n = (nq+r)-n = n(q-1)+r`$.
    - Thus, for $`q=1`$, $`0\le m-n = r \lt n`$
    - The theorem holds.
  - Case 3)
    - Consider $`k \in \mathbb{N}`$ such that $`kn \le m \lt (k+1)n`$
    - Suppose the theorem holds for $`k-1`$
      - i.e.) For $`m -n \in [(k-1)n, kn], \;\exists q',r' \textrm{ such that } m-n = nq' + r'`$
    - Then $`m = nq'+r' + n = n(q'+1)+r`$.
    - Since $`q'+1 \in \mathbb{N}`$, the theorem holds for $`k`$

#### E.g.) Chocolate Division
- Question)
  - You are given a rectangular chocolate bar consisting of $`n`$ chocolate squares. 
  - Your task is to split the bar into small squares (always breaking along the lines between the squares) with the minimum number of breaks. 
  - How many breaks will it take? Prove by induction that the result holds for any $`n`$.
- Sol.)
  - $`n-1`$
- Pf.)
  - Base cases observation)
    - Case 1) $`n=1`$
      - Then the minimum number of breaks is 0.
    - Case 2) $`n=2`$
      - In this case the shape of the rectangle will be either $`(1\times2) \vee (2\times1)`$.
      - In both cases, the minimum number of breaks is 1.
    - Case 3) $`n=3`$
      - In this case the shape of the rectangle will be either $`(1\times3) \vee (3\times1)`$.
      - Split 1)
        - In either case, we choose the maximum length and split them into two pieces : $`(1\times2)`$ and $`(1\times1)`$
      - Split 2)
        - Only $`(1\times2)`$ requires one additional break.
      - Thus, the total number of breaks is 2.
  - Pf. by Induction)
    - Put $`P(n)`$ a predicate that "If a rectangle contains $`n`$ squares of chocolate, the minimum number of breaks is $`n-1`$."
    - Then $`P(1), P(2), P(3)`$ holds.
    - Consider $`k>3`$.
    - Then for $`n = k`$, $`\exists p,q\in\mathbb{N} \textrm{ s.t. } n=k=p+q`$.
    - Suppose $`P(p), P(q)`$ holds.
    - Then $`P(n) = P(k) = 1+P(p)+P(q) = 1+(p-1)+(q-1) = p+q-1 = k-1`$

#### E.g.) Nim
- Question)
  - In the parlour game Nim, there are two players and two piles of matches. 
  - At each turn, a player removes some (non-zero) number of matches from one of the piles. 
  - The player who removes the last match wins. 
  - If the two piles contain the same number of matches at the start of the game, then the second player can always win. 
  - Figure out what the strategy for winning is and then prove this strategy does guarantee a win by using induction.
- Sol.)
