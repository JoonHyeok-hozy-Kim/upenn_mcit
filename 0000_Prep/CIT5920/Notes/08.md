# 8. Probability of Unions
### Concept) Union of Mutually Disjoint Events
- If events $`A \textrm{ and } B`$ are mutually disjoin events.
  - $`P(A \cap B) = 0`$
- Then the union goes as
  - $`P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)`$

### Example)
- Question)
  - Consider the situation in which files are stored on a distributed network that has 30 computers. 
  - Three copies of File 1 are stored at three distinct locations in the network, and three copies of File 2 are stored at three different locations in the network.
    - locations for File 1 are different from locations for File 2.
  - Suppose that there are 6 random computers that have failed. 
  - What is the probability that either file has been wiped out?
- Sol.)
  - Put 
    - $`F_1`$ : the event that all three copies of File 1 are gone
    - $`F_2`$ : the event that all three copies of File 2 are gone
  - Then   
    $`\begin{aligned}
        P(F_1 \cup F_2) &= P(F_1) + P(F_2) - P(F_1 \cap F_2) \\ 
        &= \frac{ 2 \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 27\\3 \end{pmatrix} - 1 }{ \begin{pmatrix} 30\\6 \end{pmatrix} } \\
    \end{aligned}`$
