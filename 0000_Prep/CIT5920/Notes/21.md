# Graph Theory 2
### Concept) Isomorphism
- Def.)
  - Let
    - $`G = (V, E)`$
    - $`G' = (V', E')`$
  - Then
    - $`G`$ and $`G'`$ are isomorphic if there is a bijection $`f:V\rightarrow V'`$ such that for every pair of vertices $`x,y\in V`$, $`(x,y)\in E \wedge (f(x), f(y))\in E'`$
      - the function $`f`$ is called the isomorphism from $`G`$ to $`G'`$.
- Props.)
  - Necessary Conditions for Isomorphism
    - The two graphs have to have the same number of edges and vertices.
    - Under an isomorphism the degree of a vertex is preserved. 
      - So if the vertex $`v`$ had a degree of $`k`$ in graph $`G`$. 
      - Then $`f(v)\in G'`$ must have the same degree $`k`$.
    - The degree sequence of two isomorphic graphs has to be the same. 
      - where the degree sequence of a graph is a list of the degrees of all of the vertices in non-increasing order.
  - Graphs satisfying the above but not isomorphic
