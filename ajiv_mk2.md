# 0.1 너의 일 (투석실 업무소개)
As you can see on my resume, …
-	NICU / NR nurse
  - I worked as an NICU/NR nurse for 6 years and experienced caring for infants including low-birth-weight infants, premature babies, and those suffering from diverse diseases such as pneumonia, hypoxia, and others.
  - I also performed invasive procedures such as IV insertion, G-tube insertion, enema, CBGA, IM injections, and blood draws.
Afterwards, …
  - Hemodialysis
  - I have been working as a Hemodialysis nurse for 8 months at 큰길 clinic.
  - Here, my duty includes assessing patients’ 
  - vascular access
  - vital signs
  - fluid status
  - dialysis-related complications
  - and any other underlying medical conditions. [(TOP)](#list-of-contents)

# 1. 자기소개
- Hi, I'm Aejin. I'm a nurse who is enthusiastic and responsible. 
- I have been working as a hemodialysis Nurse at 큰길 clinic 
since December 2023. Before that I worked
 as a NICU & NR Nurse at Yeouido Saint Mary's Hospital for 6 years.
- I strongly desire to work in the US where (I believe that) nurses can play more active roles.
- In 2016, I visited the US and happened to go to a nurse clinic. 
And I was impressed by the professionalism of the nurse there. 
- In South Korea, nurses tend to play more passive roles due to its culture and custom.
- On the other hand, in the US, the nurse played active role in her own clinic, which inspired me to work in the US.
- I wish I could be a professional dialysis nurse like her someday and
- I'm determined to make it happen with FMC.
  - (I have been working for around 8 months.)[(TOP)](#list-of-contents)

# 1.1 왜 투석실 옮겼는지 / 투석실 만족(enjoy)하는지?
- Back in NICU, I loved building rapport with the guardians and infants, 
but patients were always discharged quickly.
- So, the relationships felt short-lived.
- I wanted to work in a unit where I could build long-term trust with patients,
  - so I was attracted to the dialysis center.
- Here, patients and medical staff need to work closely together
for the regular and long-term treatment.
- Building strong relationships with patients makes me happy.
- So, I am satisfied with my current unit.[(TOP)](#list-of-contents)


# 1.2 병원 소개
- The clinic where I work is one of the largest hemodialysis clinics in Seoul, 
  - with a capacity of 57 beds and equipped with 45 Fresenius 5008 dialysis machines and 12 Nipro dialysis machines. 
- (Whether it's the FMC 5008 model or another, the operating principles are quite similar, so I can learn quickly..)
- And the nurse-to-patient ratio is supposed to be 1:6,
  - My patient assignment fluctuates, ranging from six patients to 18 patients.
  - I'm currently caring for 12 patients with one other nurse. 
- Eight nurses work per shift, operating on the three-shift system.
 - I have experience operating dialysis machines, infusion pumps, EKG, cardiac monitors, and defibrillators in a clinical setting. [(TOP)](#list-of-contents)

- Paper documents are used to record patient condition and blood pressure .
  - Yes. I also used EMR in previous hospital for six years.
  - (I'm not sure what specific EMR system I used) [(TOP)](#list-of-contents)

# 1.4 투석 간호사 일
- I have experience caring for a diverse patient population, 
  - including those newly initiated on hemodialysis,
  - patients with permanent catheters, 
- and chronic dialysis patients 
  - with underlying conditions 
  - such as polycystic kidney disease, gestational hypertension,
  - diabetic ESRD, and hypertensive ESRD.
- (뭐하는데?)
- For dialysis patients, I would focus on 
  - assessing their vascular access, vital signs, 
  - fluid status dialysis-related complications, 
  - and any other underlying medical conditions.
- I carefully inspect, palpate, and auscultate the access site for 
  - signs of infection, thrombosis, or infiltration. 
    - (thrill, bruit)
- While monitoring blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and 
  - temperature for any abnormalities, 
  - I also assess for fluid overload or dehydration, such as 
  - edema, shortness of breath, or hypotension. 
- In addition to closely monitoring for dialysis-related complications like 
  - muscle cramps, nausea, vomiting, or hypotension, 
  - I consider underlying medical conditions 
  - that might impact their treatment.
- (니들링 우리는 안한다.)
  - Oh really? I got it. [(TOP)](#list-of-contents)

# 2. FMC 지원 동기
- I applied for the dialysis RN position at Fresenius for the following two reasons.
- Firstly, I prefer the Fresenius machines to others.
  - The clinic where I work uses two types of machines: Fresenius and Nipro, 
    - which is a Japanese brand.
  - As an operator, I can assure you that Fresenius is far superior to Nipro.
  - This is because FMC machines are incredibly convenient and 
    - patient-safe compared to its counterpart. 
  - For example, the Fresenius machines' buttons and alarms are
    - so intuitive and effective.
  - Also their emergency buttons allow me to easily and quickly
    - initiate all necessary patient care simultaneously.
  - This is a critical advantage for patients in urgent situations.
- Secondly, I believe that Fresenius is the perfect place 
  - to develop my career as a professional dialysis nurse. 
- I want to become a proficient dialysis nurse someday, 
  - so I'm looking for a healthcare corporation 
  - where I can develop myself professionally.
- And I was very impressed with Fresenius's mission of
  - providing the best possible care to patients, 
  - which aligns perfectly with my goal.
- This is why I am particularly interested in working at your company.
- (This button stops the ultrafiltration, gets the blood pressure, and drops the blood flow rate.)
- convection.[(TOP)](#list-of-contents)

# 3. 장 단점
- My strong point is that I am an outgoing person.
- And I enjoy interacting with others, listening to their stories, and sharing opinions.
- My outgoing personality allows me to build rapport(라포어) with patients and colleagues

- On the other hand, my weak point is that I worry too much from time to time. 
- Because of that, I often spend hours thinking about potential problems and their outcomes. 

- It prevents me from making mistakes but sometimes it causes a lot of stress and anxiety. 
- So, when I realize that I am overwhelmed(오버-웲드), I try to focus on the present moment. 

- This helps me get relaxed.[(TOP)](#list-of-contents)

# 3.1 간호사 장, 단점
- (강점) I am confident in my ability to perform procedures 
  - efficiently and accurately. 
    - (I received positive feedback on my sterile technique)
- (약점) I tend to be a perfectionist,
  - which can sometimes slow me down. 
  - To address this, I try to prioritize tasks and focus on the 
    - critical elements."[(TOP)](#list-of-contents)

# 4. 팀워크 경험
- We were a team of three nurses caring for eighteen patients.
- Suddenly, an emergency CPR situation arose in the outpatient clinic room.

- Our senior nurse had to rush to assist. 
- So, the other nurse and I had to (independently) manage the 18 patients.

- Normally, we provide primary nursing, but faced with the sudden increase in workload, 

- we quickly discussed and divided the tasks based on our strengths, 
- ensuring all aspects of patient care were covered.
- I focused on reviewing test results, confirming doctor's orders.
  - and administering medications
- while my colleague was monitoring vital signs and patient conditions.

- This allowed us to maintain control and prevent any issues during the treatment.

- Fortunately, our senior nurse returned just as we were finishing up, 
  - and we briefed her on the events that happened during her absence. 

- Despite the unexpected challenge(첼린ㅈ), 
  - our team successfully completed the treatments.
- (I'm familiar with EMR, so I can work quickly.) [(TOP)](#list-of-contents)

# 4.0 CPR
- I haven't experienced a CPR situation during dialysis. 
- If I encounter a cardiac arrest during a dialysis treatment, 
  - I would immediately initiate a code blue. 
- My primary focus would be to ensure patient safety by initiating chest compressions, 
  - securing the airway, and rescue breathing, and preparing for advanced life support. 
- I would also alert my team to gather necessary equipment, 
  - such as an AED and emergency medications.
- In addition, in the dialysis unit, 
  - I would coordinate with my team to return the patient's blood 
  - and secure the vascular access. 
- I would also provide support and information to the patient's family during this difficult time.


# 4.1 팀워크- 업무가 많을 때 대처
- I prioritize tasks based on patient vital signs and needs. 
- I create a written list to make sure I don't miss any lower-priority tasks. 
- And if I find my workload is too much to handle,
  - I’ll ask my supervisor for help. [(TOP)](#list-of-contents)

# 5.리더십 경험
- Back in the NICU, as a senior nurse, 
- I sometimes took the charge nurse role. 
- I delegated duties based on each nurse's strengths and abilities. 

- For example, to our experienced nurses, 
- I assigned more complex cases,
- such as infants requiring ventilation. 
- On the other hand, for the newer nurses,
  - I assigned the tasks they could handle,
  - closely monitoring their progress and
  - providing support when needed. [(TOP)](#list-of-contents)

# 5.1 독립적으로 일한 경험
- At our clinic, each shift has five teams.
- Three teams consist of two nurses, 
- while the rest two team are staffed by a single nurse. 
- After three months of working as a dialysis nurse,
  - my manager asked me to take on the single-nurse team.
  - Eager to demonstrate my abilities, 
- I accepted the challenge and successfully managed patient care independently. [(TOP)](#list-of-contents)

# 5.2 팀.개인 뭐가 더 좋아? 
- I am fully capable(케이퍼블) of working independently,
  - but I prefer to work as a team.
- By working together, we can achieve better patient outcomes.
- Sharing ideas and supporting each other improves overall care.
- I believe in the importance of teamwork, 
  - so I'm always willing to lend a helping hand to my colleagues. [(TOP)](#list-of-contents)

# 5.3 리더쉽 뭐가 더 좋아?
- I think I work best in environments where hands-on leadership and 
  - self-sufficiency are balanced. 
- For example, I am in charge of a group consisted of 6 patients,
  - and I independently provide treatment from start to finish. 
- But I am also open to seeking advice from my supervisor
  - on complex cases or adjusting dialysis schedules.[(TOP)](#list-of-contents)

# 5.4 리더거나, 팀원 일 때
- When I am a leader, I quickly prioritize tasks and delegate them efficiently. 
- On the other hand, if I am a follower,
  - I follow my leader’s directions responsibly and 
  - keep my leader informed of important matters.[(TOP)](#list-of-contents)

# 5.5 Unexpected work?
- I remember one day when a nursing assistant was out sick. 
- The clinic was short-staffed, 
  - so I was asked to help with bed making 
  - and sterilizing medical equipment.
- It was a busy day, but I was able 
  - to complete all my tasks. I was happy to help my team.[(TOP)](#list-of-contents)


# 18.필요한 표현 (mid)

  - My fiancé is pursuing a master's degree in Philadelphia and 
    - he will do the doctor's as well.
  - I heard that it will take at least 6 to 7 years.

  - Could you please tell me the specific location of this clinic?
  - That's amazing! University City is so close to that place!

  - Many dialysis patients are elderly. 
    - Studying gerontology will help me better understand their specific needs. [(TOP -mid)](#mid)


# 6. 트러블 환자랑
- One day, a patient attempted to touch me in a sexually inappropriate way.

- I politely but firmly asked(에스드) him to refrain from such unwanted contact.

- Unfortunately, the patient persisted.

- Although I felt uncomfortable, 
- I prioritized(프라이오리타이즈드) the safety of other patients.
	
- In order not to agitate them, I calmly reported the incident to my supervisor.

- It was a very difficult experience, but
  - I learned how to deal with such challenging situations.
- (It was determined that the patient's care would be better managed at another facility.)[(TOP -mid)](#mid)

# 7. conflict
# 7.1 Doctor or 동료 
  - Once, I had a patient who needed to set dialysis ultrafiltration for 3kgs, 
    - but his initial blood pressure was lower than usual,( around 100 millimeters of mercury systolic.) 
  - So, I decided to start the machine at 2.5kgs,
    - planning to gradually increase it as the patient's blood pressure stabilized.

  - However, the doctor on rounds was not aware 
    - of the patient’s condition
     - and continuously urged me to change the setting.

  - I was worried that arguing in front of the patient 
    - would make him anxious, 
    - so I took the doctor aside to discuss the situation. 

  - It turned out that the doctor thought that
    - I had mistakenly set the ultrafiltration on the machine. 

  - I explained that I had lowered the setting 
    - due to the patient's low initial blood pressure, and 
    - was planning to monitor their blood pressure
    - before increasing it.

  - We were able to understand each other's perspectives
    - and resolve the issue.
   
  - So, I think that effective communication is 
    - essential for resolving conflicts.
  - (That patient typically experiences 
    - a significant rise in blood pressure 
    - toward the end of dialysis sessions, 
    - which is then well-maintained.) [(TOP -mid)](#mid)

# 7.2 일반적
  - To begin with, we often work under high pressure, so I try not to take anything personally. 
  - Instead, I think communication is the most important key.
  - so I would ask the colleague who I am in trouble with to have a conversation with me. 
  - Then, I would actively listen to his or her situation and try to understand that person’s perspective. 
  - If we cannot resolve the problem and it affects the patient care,
  - I would then involve a supervisor by following the chain of command. [(TOP -mid)](#mid)


# 8. 가장 큰 첼린지 ? [나중에 보완 전직.]
- (챌린지 기존 서론)
  - Starting a new career in the dialysis center,
    - performing invasive procedures such as cannulation was most challenging.
  - For example, one day, a patient complained during the procedure.  
  - Of course, I understood that he experienced discomfort(컴) during the procedure.
- (환자와의 트러블로 서론) 
  - One day, a patient complained during cannulation and
    - refused to receive my treatment.
  - Of course, I understood that he experienced discomfort(컴) during the procedure,
    - because of its invasive nature.
- (본론)
  - So, I actively listened to his feelings and tried to be empathetic,
    - while offering sincere apologies.   
  - However, I realized that empathy(엠퍼띠) alone wasn’t enough.   
  - To minimize patient discomfort and risk,
  - I practiced a lot using plastic cannulation tubes.   
  - Today, most patients are satisfied with my technique.(니)
  - I was happy when the same patient later told me
    - that he was satisfied with my care. 
  - This challenging experience taught me the importance of empathy 
    - and finding solutions collaboratively.
  - (I believe that my ability to perform all aspects of dialysis and 
    - my comprehensive understanding of the process 
    - allow me to provide an optimal experience for my patients.) [(TOP -mid)](#mid)



# 9. 실수
- When I was working in the dialysis clinic for about two months,
  - a patient experienced a sudden drop in blood pressure 
  - at the end of the hemodialysis treatment. 
- So, I quickly(쿠이클리) stopped the treatment. 	

- After the patient recovered and left the clinic,
- I realized I had missed administering an erythropoietin(이리쓰로포이에틴) injection. 

- I became very nervous, wondering what if something went wrong.
- Still, I reported the incident to a senior nurse without hesitation. 

- We decided to administer the injection
  - during the next treatment with the doctor’s confirmation.
- This was because the patient received the injection once a week.

- This incident reinforced my belief in the importance of honesty.
- (If I hadn't told the truth, the patient would have skipped the injection for a week.) [(TOP -mid)](#mid)

  - I apologize(자이즈), I thought you were asking me.
  - (Were you asking someone else? I misunderstood)
- (위치)
  - Could you please tell me the specific location of this clinic?
  - That's amazing! University City is so close to that place! 
  - I was even considering a one-hour commute. 
- (기대됩니다)
  - I'm very excited about that. 
- (니들링 우리는 안한다.)
  - Oh really? I got it.
- (출퇴근 오래걸림)
  - I can handle a 1-hour commute. I'm already doing it.
- (대학원)
  - Many dialysis patients are elderly. 
    - Studying gerontology will help me better understand their specific needs. [(TOP -mid)](#mid)

# 신규추가
# 19 테크니션이랑?
- We don’t have technicians in Korean dialysis centers. 
- So, nurses deal with most of the dialysis procedures
  - and control the machines. 
- But if the machine does not work properly, 
  - we call Fresenius Korea specialists.[(TOP -mid)](#mid)

# 20. Disagreement with your manager
- As a team member, I believe in following leadership.
- In my experience, my supervisors have generally made sound decisions, 
  - which I've been happy to support. 
- However, if I ever disagree with a decision,
  - I would first try to understand the meaning behind it.
- If I still have concerns after discussing the matter,
  - I would follow the chain of commands to address the issue.[(TOP -mid)](#mid)


# 21. 인지장애
- No, I haven’t. But I will learn from my colleagues how to deal with them and quickly get used to it.[(TOP -mid)](#mid)

# 22. 5am?
- I already start working at 6 am and it takes 
  - more than an hour to work now. So, 5 am will be okay with me.[(TOP -mid)](#mid)

# 23. acute
- I want to apply for the acute dialysis hospital.
- Sometimes, patients in very serious condition come into our clinic. 
- But, I always felt so helpless when I couldn't treat them and had to send them
  - to a bigger hospital.
- That's why I'm trying to transfer to a hospital in Korea 
  - to gain experience with a wider range of cases 
  - and improve my skills as a hemodialysis nurse.
- It'll probably take about two years before I can land in the US,
  - so I'm going to make the most of my time in Korea 
  - to gain as much experience with acute cases as possible.[(TOP -mid)](#mid)

- (PWD설명)
  - It’s a previous stage of I-140 in immigration process 
  - and I heard that it can be done 
  - before applying for I-140 by the employer. 


- (이미 진행중이라고 한다면)
  - Could you provide an update 
  - on which stage that clinic stands in the PWD process?"

- [구글맵.]
  - Could you tell me the spelling of the name of the clinic?
  -  I want to search for it on Google Maps.
  -  I'm open to a commute of up to an hour and a half. [(TOP -mid)](#mid)


# 25. 연봉
- [연봉제안 하라면 ]
  - I checked the indeed and the glassdoor and they said the average salary for dialysis is about 41 to 42 dollars per hour

- [연봉]
  - I think that’s reasonable. 

- [너무 적은 경우]
  - Thanks for the offer ,
  - but I can assure you that my 6 years of nursing experience
  - and my familiarity with the FMC machines will be helpful for your company and for the patients. 
  - Besides, considering the living cost of Pennsylvania
  - 00 dollars per hours is not enough. 
  - Could you raise it up a bit more. [(TOP -mid)](#mid)

## 26-4 필리말고 다른데도 연결해줘
- I really appreciate your efforts to 
  - consider my situation and 
  - forward me to Philadelphia.
- But, even if it's far from Pennsylvania, could you introduce me to a center that 
  - has a high demand for international nurses? 
- (섀넌 눈치 한 번 보고)
- The reason that I’m saying this is because 
  - I'm concerned that 
    - facilities in Philly may not have a high demand for international nurses because 
    - there are already many local nurses.
- (For me, the most important thing is 
  - to start the immigration process as soon as possible.) [(섀넌2 Top)](#shannon-interview-2)



## 26-5 가고 싶은 곳 어필
- For me, the facility that can support the prompt immigration process 
  - is the top priority. 
- So, it wouldn't matter if the clinic is far from Philly such as 
  - New Jersey, Delaware especially Wilmington, Maryland, Virginia, and so on. 
- Any clinic is great with me if it can actively support my immigration process.  [(섀넌2 Top)](#shannon-interview-2)

## 26-9 에이전시 지원 했어?
- I've been very interested in Fresenius and 
  - have applied through various channels, 
  - including an agency. 
- Did it pose any issue with my employment process? [(섀넌2 Top)](#shannon-interview-2)




## 26-10 다음 기회
- I appreciate you letting me know.
- Actually, I was so eager to work at Fresenius and 
  - was exploring various options to increase my chances. 
- So, I had already applied through a direct hiring agency called WWHS. 
- Then, I was forwarded to a Fresenius clinic in Maryland, and 
  - only the final interview was left.
- But after I started the direct hiring process with you, 
  - they somehow closed my case and 
  - could not do the final interview. 
- Currently, it seems all my opportunities are gone. 
- Could you please be generous and find other facilities that are left? 
- I am really desperate.
- (그래도 안 된다.)
  - I understand your decision.
  - Would there be any opportunities for me to apply again in the future? [(섀넌2 Top)](#shannon-interview-2)
