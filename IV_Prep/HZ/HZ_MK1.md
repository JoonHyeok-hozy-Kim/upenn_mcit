2. [Difficult Technical Challenge](#2-difficult-technical-challenge)


## 1. Complex Project
- I had the chance to work on a project developing specialized devaluation logic for 
  - LG Electronics' car infotainment department. 
- This project was particularly challenging 
  - because of the unique characteristics of batteries compared to other home appliances.
- Unlike other products that only considered existing production and 
  - sales data for devaluation calculations, 
  - batteries required a more dynamic approach. 
- Factors like current production trends and LG Electronics' B2B sales results 
  - needed to be incorporated into the calculations.
- To achieve this, I analyzed and organized a massive amount of production and sales data using Python. 
- And I identified trends that could inform the development of the devaluation logic.
- I shared my findings with the clients, 
  - who requested specific accounting treatments for the dynamic parameters in the algorithms. 
- This project was especially tricky because battery production was not yet stabilized. 
- It was difficult to distinguish between noise data and new, unstable data
- So, it required extensive testing.
- Despite these challenges, we successfully developed an algorithm that 
  - calculated justifiable devaluation values.
- And fortunately, the LG Electronics' business administration was also satisfied with the result. 
- This project was valuable because it taught me how to effectively collaborate with clients 
  - who had limited programming knowledge and deliver a result that met their expectations.
            

## 2. Difficult Technical Challenge
- For me, one of the biggest challenges I faced was 
  - supporting the real-time cost calculation process for LG Electronics' Monthly Closing. 
- This was a monthly event that accounting managers from 135 branches world wide
  - simultaneously closing their financial accounts at the beginning of each month.
- This process was incredibly complex and time-consuming because
  - account managers had to check their monthly production and sales data and
  - they had to perform numerous manual operations on the system.
- My duty was to support technical issues when these managers had trouble closing their accounts.
- The human errors were inevitable due to the complicated process of cost calculation and
  - the amount of data accounting managers had to check during the procedure.
- So, whenever multiple managers got in trouble simultaneously,
  - they all requested the solution and there was a bottle neck on the whole closing process.
- To address these issues, I thought about the way to simplify the closing process.
- Of course it was impossible to simplify the cost calculation process itself,
  - but I had an idea that some procedures could be skipped,
  - depending on the data.
- For example, when checking the gap between the receiving amount on the accounting book and
  - the actual business data recorded on the ERP system are small enough
  - we could remove accounting managers' burden by automatically skipping such process.
- Based on this idea, I developed a solution that automated several steps of the process based on the dataset. 
- I devised ways to automate the process while ensuring accurate calculations, 
  - such as modifying the process to require manual input only when certain data exceeded a threshold. 
- I also created a user-friendly interface that allowed users 
  - to set these thresholds themselves and easily correct errors.
- Based on these improvements, I proposed a program automation project to my team leader and the client. 
- The project was successfully implemented, significantly reducing my workload during the closing process and 
  - substantially improving the overall speed of LG Electronics' monthly closing.
    

## 3. Collaboration with Team
- Listening and understanding are the key factors in communication
  - To satisfy counterpart's exact need or to find reasonable consensus when the opinions vary
- Experience of participating in a project that needed collaboration with other systems.
  - My system was in the middle of the data pipeline in the project and had to build new data interface structure.
  - Thus, I had to consider the business logics of the both the data providing and the data receiving systems.
  - It was challenging the reconcile the data delivery time between two systems.
      - My programs received the data from the data providing system, operated complicated calculation process, and interfaced the summary result to the data receiving system
      - Data providing system generated data in real time with massive volume
      - Data receiving system required intermittent and on-demand data interface depending on their business needs
      - Considering the limited computing and memory resource, it was impossible for my system to operate real time in-advance calculation and to store the result for the potential request from the data receiving.
  - I made up an idea of decoupling the notification of the data availability and the process of actual data calculation and interface.
      - Set up additional data interface from data source system directly to the data receiving system, notifying the specific data availability condition that the receiving side required.
      - Designed an on-demand data calculation and interface when the receiving system requested the actual operation.
    

## 4. Prioritizing Multiple Tasks
- I deal with such hard situations by setting up a granular and specific schedules. Once such a vivid plan is made, I can see the bigger picture more easily and focus on small tasks one by one which keeps me from being overwhelmed by the volume of the whole project.
- Once, I was deployed into two projects simultaneously. Initially, I was focusing on one project. Because this project was suggested by myself, I was playing a leading role in it. I had to manage a small group of members along with my own software developments tasks.  Then, one of my colleagues in my department suddenly left his position and someone had to support the development tasks that he left behind. Our department leader asked for my assistance. I addressed my opinion that the project that I was already handling was quite challenging so I was not sure I could manage two projects simultaneously. However, my leader pointed out that it's an emergency situation and considering the lack of human resource and my familiarity with the business logics related to the project, I should be the one who should assist it. I agreed with his opinion and took the role. 
- At first it was overwhelming because the initial project itself was challenging on the point that it was my first time playing a management role and the development role.
- Set up a vivid schedule for the first project.
- Tried to specify my roles in the second project as accurate as possible.
- Reschedule the first project. Communication with the client postponing the deadline.
- Asked advices from senior engineers with ample experiences.
    
    
## 5. Trouble with Team Member
- Frequent communication to understand the team member's situation is the first priority.
- As long as the team member shows his or her intension to contribute to the team's success, I try to be as supportive as possible.
- While I was supporting system management service for the Cost module of LG Electronics, a new engineer joined our module. He seemed so confident about his success in his new role and showed great enthusiasm towards it. I respected his work ethics and had no doubt about his success. However, he continuously lagged behind the deadlines of user requests, which was a critical to our team's assessment. I was worried about his progress so I tried to check if everything was okay with him. He kept on showing his confidence, so all I could do was nothing but to trust him.
- Then, I had an opportunity to participate in a small project with him. While doing some scrum meetings with him, I realized that he lacked critical knowledge about our module because he could not receive enough education from the senior engineers. They were so busy when he came to our module and simply forgot to provide such assistance. Meanwhile, this engineer did not wanted to give an impression that he was incapable of solving problems or irresponsible for his role, he somehow tried to deal with his difficulty all by himself not asking for some help.
- I could empathize his situation as a newly joined member and wanted to help him. So I shared my notes that I wrote to study the program sets and business logic ever since I joined our module. And I suggested my team leader that I could spare some o
