## 1. Distributions and Data
### Definitions)
- Instance Space (Input Space) : $`X`$ 
- Outcome Space (Output Space) : $`Y`$ 
- Examples : $`\langle x,y \rangle \text{ where } x\in X, y\in Y`$
- Distributions : $`P`$ over $`X\times Y`$ where $`\langle x,y \rangle \stackrel{\text{i.i.d}}{\sim} P`$
  - $`P`$ is possibly arbitrarily complex
- Sample : $`S = \{\langle x_1,y_1 \rangle, \langle x_2,y_2 \rangle, \cdots, \langle x_n,y_n \rangle\}`$ 
  - each $`\langle x_i,y_i \rangle \stackrel{\text{i.i.d.}}{\sim} P`$
  - cf.) $`\vert S \vert = n`$

### Remarks)
- Instance Space $`X`$
  - Often, we will choose information/feature that goes into $`X`$.
  - Usefully choose features that are predictive/informative of $`y\in Y`$
  - Some features/information might favor (disfavor) certain individuals and groups.
    - e.g.) Zip code may disclose the race.
    - e.g.) Extracurricular activity may disclose the income level of a student.
  - Even obvious info/features may encode bias
- Outcome $`y\in Y`$
  - Sometimes the outcome y are objectively measurable and unbiased.
    - e.g.) stock ending price, temperature
  - Other times $`y`$ ("the ground truth") is more subjective.
    - Subjectivity on the answer.
      - e.g.) Are two face images are from a same person?
    - Sometimes $`y`$s are biased or filtered.
      - e.g.) Students at Penn with CGPA higher than 3.0 will be successful. 
        - People not applied to Penn and applied but rejected are all excluded. (Bias!)

<br>

## 2. Outcome and Predictions
- Our goal is to use sample $`S`$ to make predictions $`\hat{y}`$ for new $`x\notin S`$.
- Our prediction will be in the form of a model or a function $`h`$ s.t. $`\hat{y} = h(x)`$
- We allow/assume that $`P`$ might be **arbitrarily complex**.
  - cf.) Black box that we can not describe but can sample from this.
- But models $`h`$ will be simple by necessity.
  - cf.) Model should be able to compress the data!
    - e.g.) Consider a model that keeps the data itself and return the label.
      - Terribly biased.

<br>

## 3. Models and Model Classes
- model : $`h(x)`$ based on $`\hat{\epsilon}(h)`$
  - We choose it.
  - Simple model!
- "Pre-identify" model class $`H`$
  - e.g.)
    - tabular data set : Logistic regression, Decision Tree
    - CV : CNN
- Hope that $`h\in H`$ with "small" $`\hat{\epsilon}(h)`$ will also have small $`\epsilon(h)`$.

<br>

## 4. Training and Testing
- Training Errors of $`h(x)`$ on $`S`$.
  - Binary Classification Model
    - Def.) $`\displaystyle \hat{\epsilon_S}(h) = \hat{\epsilon}(h)  \triangleq \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n I[h(x_i)\ne y_i]`$
        - where $`I`$ is an indicator function s.t. $`I[\cdot] = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if true} \\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}`$
  - Regression Model
    - Def.) $`\displaystyle\hat{\epsilon}(h) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n (h(x_i) - y_i)^2`$
- True Error (Test Error) of $`h(x)`$ on $`P`$
  - Def.) $`\epsilon_P(h) = \epsilon(h) \triangleq \mathbb{E}_{\langle x,y \rangle\sim P} \left[ I[h(x_i)\ne y_i] \right] = \text{Pr}_{\langle x,y \rangle\sim P}\left[ h(x_i)\ne y_i \right]`$

#### Case Study 1: Decision Trees for Lending
- Goal)
  - Predict who will repay a loan.
- Settings)
  - $`y=\begin{cases}
      0 & \text{: default} \\ 1 & \text{: repaid}
  \end{cases}`$
  - $`x`$ might contain
    - credit history
    - current employment/salary
    - savings
    - Demographics : age, gender, race
    - social media usage
    - religion, politics
- Model)
  - Decision Tree
    - Prop.)
      - Depth = 3
    - e.g.) Nodes
      |||||||||||
      |:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
      ||||||Income $`\ge`$ 50K|||||
      ||| y |||||| n ||
      |||Age $`\ge`$ 30||||||Employed?||
      ||   y   || n |||| y || n |
      ||$`\hat{y}=1`$||High school graduate?||||$`\hat{y}=1`$||$`\hat{y}=0`$|
      | |       | y |   | n |   |   |   |   |   |
      | |       |$`\hat{y}=1`$|   |$`\hat{y}=0`$||||||
      - cf.) Why not increasing depth to the maximum
        - Overfitting
          - Not available for the new data.
        - Computational complexity
          - Exponential number of nodes $`2^d`$ for the depth $`d`$.
      - cf.) How to choose good DT?
        - Calculate entropy of each test candidates.
          - $`H(p) = p\log_2\frac{1}{p} + (1-p)\log_2\frac{1}{1-p}`$
        - Choose the one with the maximum entropy.
        - This is a greedy method heuristic.
          - No guarantee that the result is the global optimum.

#### Case study 2: Neural Networks for Cat Detection
- Goal)
  - Determine whether there is a cat in an image.
- Settings)
  - $`y=\begin{cases}
      0 & \text{: no cat} \\ 1 & \text{: cat}
  \end{cases}`$
  - $`x`$ is a digital image in $`256\times 256`$ pixel format.
- Model) NN
  - Input : $`256\times 256`$ pixel values $`x_1, \cdots, x_{190K}`$
  - In each layer, some portion of inputs are connected.
    - e.g.) $`\displaystyle I\left(\sum_{i=1}^{100}w_ix_i \gt \theta \right)`$
      - In this case, we cannot differentiate. So, cannot apply gradient descent.
      - sigmoid function can be the substitute.

### Thm.) "Fundamental Theorem" of Machine Learning
- Thm)
  - No matter what $`P`$ looks like.
  - for any "reasonable" model class $`H`$
  - if we have "enough" data $`S`$
    - "enough" : $`n=\vert S\vert`$ is large compared to the "complexity" of $`H`$
      - "complexity" : may differ by model but the number of parameters can be a proxy for this.
  - then for every $`h\in H`$ we have $`\hat{\epsilon_S}(h) = \epsilon_P(h)`$
- Versions)
  - Case when the model class $`H`$ is finite (i.e. $`\vert H \vert`$ is finite)
    - Thm.)
      - If $`n = \frac{1}{\alpha^2}\log\vert H\vert`$, then $`\left\vert \hat{\epsilon_S}(h) - \epsilon_P(h) \right\vert \le \alpha, \; \forall h\in H`$
    - Prop.)
      - Consider that DT's nodes increase exponentially.
        - Due to $`\log\vert H \vert`$, the complexity becomes linear!
      - $`\log\vert H \vert`$ can be interpreted as the number of bits required to denote every possible models.
