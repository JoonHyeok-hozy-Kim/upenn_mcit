# Bayesian Optimization
### Concept) Iterative Optimization Algorithm
- Initial State)
  - $`\mathcal{D} = \{(x_1, y_1), \cdots, (x_n, y_n)\}`$ : given data
- Process)
  1. Determine $`x^* = \text{policy}(\mathcal{D})`$.
     - Meaning)
       - Determine what to do next based on the previous data.
     - e.g.)
       - Gradient Descent
         - Find the maximum gradient and proceed with that direction.
  2. Get $`y^* = \text{observe}(x^*)`$
     - Meaning)
       - Way to observe new data.
     - e.g.)
       - Bayesian Optimization 
         - $`y^*`$ is a Gaussian distribution, which is from the marginal of all other data points.
         - Recall that there is always the noise.
  3. Update $`\mathcal{D} \leftarrow \mathcal{D} \cup \{(x^*, y^*)\}`$
- Training)
  - Train a model on $`\mathcal{D}`$.
  - The objective is to get $`p(y^* \vert x^*, D)`$
    - Recall that $`y^*`$ is also a probability distribution.

### Concept) Acquisition Function
- Desc.)
  - A function that assigns a score to potential observation locations commensurate with their perceived ability to benefit the optimization process.
  - It tends to be cheap to evaluate with analytically tractable gradients.
  - Various acquisition functions are used in BO.
    - They all address the classic tension between [exploitation](#concept-exploitation) and [exploration](#concept-exploration).
  - The acquisition function vanishes at the location of the current observations
    - i.e.) No information gain.

#### Concept) Exploitation
- Sampling where the objective function is expected to be high

#### Concept) Exploration
- Sampling where we are uncertain about the objective function to inform future decisions

#### Concept) Trade-off between Exploitation and Exploration
- Acquisition function attains relatively large values both near... 
  - ([exploitation](#concept-exploitation)) : local maxima of the posterior mean
  - ([exploration](#concept-exploration)) : in regions with significant marginal uncertainty

### Bayesian Optimization Theory
- Settings)
  - $`\mathcal{A}`$ : an action space
  - $`\mathcal{X}`$ : an input space
    - i.e.) the set of all design variables
  - $`u : \mathcal{X} \times \mathcal{Y} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}`$ : an utility function
    - i.e.) How good $`\mathcal{D}`$ is
