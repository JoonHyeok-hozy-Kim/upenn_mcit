# 1 Memory, Heap, Classes
### Concept) nullptr
- Desc.) `nullptr`
  - Pointers that refer to nothing by assigning pointers the value
  - Indicates that the pointer is currently uninitialized or not in use. 
  - Crashes when...
    - dereferencing `nullptr`
    - accessing the value at a pointer holding `nullptr`

<br>

### Concept) Stack
- Desc.)
  - Grows, but has a static max size
    - How to get the default size.
      - `unlimit -all` in bash.
      - `getrlimit(3)` at runtime.
  - Max Size of a stack can be changed.
    - How to 
      - `setrlimit(3)`

### Concept) Dynamic Memory Allocation/Deallocation
- Allocation
  - Desc.)
    - At run time!
    - Dynamic memory can be of variable size.
    - Dynamically allocated memory persists until either...
      - A garbage collector collects it : Java, Python
      - Your code “explicitly” deallocates it : C, C++
- Deallocation
  - Desc.)
    - Stack vs Heap
      - Stack data is deallocated when the function returns
      - Heap data is deallocated when our program deallocates it.
        - Garbage collector for high level languages.
        - Manual freeing in low level languages.
- Syntax
  - `new`
    - Desc.)
      - searches for a large enough unused block of memory
      - marks the memory as allocated
      - Returns a pointer to the beginning of that memory
  - `delete`
    - Desc.)
      - Takes in a pointer to a previously allocated address
      - Marks the memory as free to use.
  - `delete[]` for arrays!
- Pitfalls
  - Buffer Overflows
    - if we leak the memory a lot.
  - Giving `delete` a pointer to the middle of an allocated region
    - Delete won’t recognize the block of memory and probably crash
  - `delete`-ing a pointer that has already been freed
    - will crash.
  - `new` does NOT initialize memory unless you give it an initial value


<br>

### Concept) Heap
- Desc.)
  - A large pool of available memory to use for Dynamic allocation.
  - This pool of memory is kept track of with a small data structure indicating...
    - which portions have been allocated
    - which portions are currently available.


<br>

### Concept) Class in C++
- Syntax)
  - In `.hpp` file
    ```cpp
    #ifndef POINT_HPP_
    #define POINT_HPP_

    class Point{
        public:     // access modifier
            Point(int x, int y);    // constructor
            int get_x() { return x_; }    // inline member function
            int get_y() { return y_; }    // inline member function
            double dot_prod(Point p);     // member function
            void set_location(int x, int y);

        private:    // access modifier
            int x_;     // field
            int y_;     // field
    };    // semi-colon at the end!
    ```
  - In `.cpp` file
    ```cpp
    #include "Point.hpp"

    Point::Point(int x, int y){
        x_ = x;
        this->y_ = y;   // this is a Point* const (optional)
    }

    double Point::dot_prod(Point p){
        double prod = x_ * p.get_x();
        prod += (y_ * p.get_y());
        return prod;
    }

    void Point::set_location(int x, int y){
        x_ = x;
        y_ = y;
    }
    ```
- Desc.)
  - Constructor
    - A constructor (ctor) initializes a newly-instantiated object.
    - A class can have multiple constructors that differ in parameters.
    - A constructor is always invoked when creating a new instance of an object.
- Prop.)
  - C++ objects are actually on the stack.
    - cf.) In Java, every object is actually instantiated on the heap and the variable is the reference to that instance.
