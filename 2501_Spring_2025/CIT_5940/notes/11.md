# 11. Software Design
### Concept) Software Design
- Desc.)
  - An iterative process
  - Providing details about components necessary to implement S/W.
    - [Classes](#concept-class-design)
    - Data Structures
    - Software Architectures

<br><br>

### Concept) Class Design
- Concepts)
  - **Abstraction** : set of **information properties** relevant to a **stakeholder** about an entity
    - where
      - **Information Property** : a named, objective and quantifiable aspect of an entity
      - **Stakeholder** : a real or imagined person (or a class of people) who is seen as the audience for, or user of the abstraction being defined
  - **Information Hiding** : prevents client(s) from accessing some aspect of the class (or software system) implementation
    - How?)
      - [Interface](#eg-interface)
      - [Encapsulation](#concept-encapsulation)
- Desiderata)
  - Complete and sufficient
    - Design should [encapsulate](#concept-encapsulation) all attributes and methods that are expected
  - Primitive
    - Methods in a class should accomplish one service for the class.
    - A class should not have more than one method to accomplish the same function
  - High cohesion
    - A cohesive design class has a small, focused set of responsibilities
    - Single-mindedly applies attributes and methods to implement those responsibilities
  - Low coupling
    - Classes collaborate with each other
    - Collaboration should be kept to a minimum and mediated through interfaces wherever possible
    - High coupling leads to software that is difficult to implement, to test, and to maintain over time

#### e.g.) Interface
```java
public interface Derivable{
    void drive();
    void park();
    void reverse();
}

public class Car implements Drivable{
    // ...
}

public class Bus implements Drivable{
    // ...
}

public class DerivableClient{
    public static void main(){
        Derivable car = new Car();
        Derivable bus = new Bus();
        car.drive();
        bus.drive();
    }
}
```
- Desc.)
  - Users do not need to care about how `Car` and `Bus` are implemented.
  - They can just use them as `Derivable`s.

<br>

#### Concept) Encapsulation
- Desc.)
  - By using `private` access modifiers on **fields** and providing `public` **getter and setter methods**, encapsulation restricts direct access to the data and allows controlled manipulation. 
  - This helps protect the internal state of an object and ensures that it can only be modified in a controlled manner, maintaining data integrity and promoting modularity in code.



<br><br>

#### Concept) Unified Modeling Language (UML)
- Desc.)
  - A modeling language intended to provide a standard way to visualize the design of a software system.


<br><br>

### Concept) Class Diagram
- Desc.)
  - Static diagram that describes the structure of a system by showing the system's classes, their attributes, operations (or methods), and the relationships among objects
- Sections)
  |Section|Desc.|
  |:-:|:-|
  |Upper Section|Contains the name of the class|
  |Middle Section|Contains the attributes of the class|
  |Bottom Section|Includes class operations (methods header). Displayed in list format, each operation takes up its own line|

  - [Domain Model Diagram](#concept-domain-model-diagram)
    - Used for this slide.
  - [Diagram of Implementation Classes](#concept-diagram-of-implementation-classes)

#### Concept) Domain Model Diagram
|Desc.|e.g.|
|:-|:-|
|- Emphasizes classes, interfaces, associations, usage, realizations, and multiplicity.<br>- Used to show how entities relate.<br>- Totally abstract implementation details.|<img src="../images/11/002.png" width="500px">|
- Syntax)
  - Data Fields
    - `+` : public
    - `-` : private
    - `#` : protected
    - `/` : derived
    - `~` : package (default)
  - Methods
    - underlined : static methods
    - Parameter types are listed as "name: type".
    - No return type for the void return.
  - Association
    - Def.)
      - All relationships in [UML](#concept-unified-modeling-language-uml) are considered associations
    - General Syntax)

      - Composition Relationship
        - Desc.)
          - When attempting to represent real-world whole-part relationships.
          - When the container is destroyed, the contents are also destroyed.
          - Usually refers to a collection (or data structure!) of some kind
        - e.g.)

      - Aggregation Relationship
        - Desc.)
          - Weak form of aggregation.
          - When the container is destroyed, the contents are usually not destroyed.
          - Usually refers to a collection (or data structure!) of some kind
